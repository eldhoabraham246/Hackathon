AERIAL CROP MONITORING QUAD
ABSTRACT
Kerala is famous for the production of Coconut, Paddy, Tea, Coffee and Spices. Rice is the most important food crop grown in Kerala, as well as Tea and Coffee are irreplaceable plantations. Paddy occupies a total of 7.46% of cropped area of the state. There is a huge loss of crops due to the presence of some insects and the unpredictable change in climatic conditions. According to the studies there is an average of 40% crop loss annually due to the attack of insects like Brown plant Hoppers in paddy fields. Hopper burn is a noncontagious disease of plants caused by the direct feeding damage of certain leafhoppers and planthoppers.
	If we can identify the presence of these type of disease at the early stage we can take needful precautions to overcome this problem. The yellowing and browning of the plant leaves are the common symptoms shown by these diseases. It is very tedious and a time consuming process for farmers to manually inspect and identify this symptoms in a vast area due to lack of technology. Our solution is to implement a user friendly drone which is capable of autonomous flying and detection of this symptoms with the help of Machine Learning. The drone help us to identify the exact location where the symptoms are present and notify the user with precise details. The drone captures images of plants while fly above it. The captured image is processed and compared with pretrained models and it detects the symptoms. The drone can also collect atmospheric factors like temperature, humidity and  UV index, which plays crucial role in agriculture and this helps farmers to take necessary action for the protection of crops
